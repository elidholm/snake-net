## Neural Network from Scratch in Python
This repository contains an implementation of a neural network from
scratch using [Python](https://www.python.org/), with minimal reliance
on external packages. The goal is to provide a clear and educational
example of how neural networks operate at a fundamental level, offering
insights into both neural network theory and Python programming.

### Features
- **Pure Python Implementation:** Built using Python's standard library,
  avoiding heavy dependencies to external libraries and packages.
- **Educational:** Designed to help me understand the inner workings
  of neural networks and how they can be implemented from the ground
  up.
- **Extensible:** The codebase is structured to allow easy extension
  and experimentation with different network architectures and learning
  algorithms.
